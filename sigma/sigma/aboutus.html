		<p> <strong>Who are we?</strong> </br></br>
We are part of the Design for America student group at MIT.</br></br>

<strong>What are we doing?</strong></br></br>
Our problem space for this semester is to increase girls' awareness and exposure to STEM.
This middle school hackathon planner aims to help college clubs or middle schools
plan hackathons all around the country and encourage middle schools girls to pursue STEM!</br></br>

<strong>Why are we doing this?</strong></br></br>
 Middle school is a crucial time period when students begin
 deciding what they want their career path to look like.</p> <!//don't say that "we noticed"--state as a fact>
